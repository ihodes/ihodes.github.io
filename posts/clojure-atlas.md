Though I know I'm late to the party, I've been enjoying poking around [Chas Emerick's](http://cemerick.com/) newest project, [Clojure Atlas](http://clojureatlas.com). It's particularly pleasant to use it in conjunction with the [Github page for Clojure](https://github.com/clojure/clojure), move to the relevant `.clj` and browse around it with the Atlas in accompaniment.

The Atlas is essentially a live graph connecting functions, macros, "Classes", reader syntax and just about everything else you can think of. A single click brings up the source code, as well as the documentation. My one complaint is that the graph takes too long to *stop moving*, making it difficult to quickly navigate: according to his Twitter (and my memory), this is something he's working on. My one wish for the product: integration with [ClojureDocs](http://clojuredocs.org/), a great resource for burgeoning Clojurers and a way to make Clojure Atlas more accesible to those who are newer to the language, as well as make it more of an encyclopedia.

<p>
It costs <span>\$</span>40 if you buy the Atlas for Clojure 1.2 and 1.3 (coming soon), or just <span>\$</span>5 if you'd like to buy the 1.2 version. It is definitely worth a look.
