Questions often become clearer once you've put together a credible model of the system you're investigating.

A sensitivity analysis of the model (i.e. change some inputs of the model, and see how much the outputs react) can help you understand the dynamics of the system, and gain same familiarity with the most important points of leverage or risks.

Althought the model won't be a perfect representation of the system you're seeking to understand[^map-territory], I'm still often surprised how a model can make tangible what was previously a hazy concept, and provide a greater degree of intuition around how the system acts. 

Models can be powerful arguments for or against something. A conversation can be moved from the abstract to the concrete, debating inputs or the structure of the model. This can be distracting if taken too far, but often advances the discourse.

In my work, I've used models to make the case for investment in certain areas (e.g. ramping up hiring of a critical role), or to argue against the pursuit of a particular line of business. I've used novel visualizations to demonstrate how diseases are represented in various populations, suggesting care management capabilities to invest in.

Models—whether spreasheets or graphs or maps—are powerful tools for communication. Reach for them more often.

Some examples of simple public models that help make complex concepts understandable:

* **Leveraged buyout models**: the effect of leverage (debt) on returns, and the importance of free-cash flow become so clear once modeled out
* **Punnett squares** predict the genotypes of offspring, and is a representation of Mendelian inheritance many of us become familiar with in primary school
* **Compound interest** visualization can drive home the power of compounding
